Abstract

Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode posi- tional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. We publish the checkpoints of Llama 2 7B/13B fine-tuned using YaRN with 64k and 128k context windows at https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn.

Introduction

Transformer-based Large Language Models [34] (LLMs) have demonstrated strong abilities to perform in-context learning (ICL) and have become the near-ubiquitous choice for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The self-attention mechanism of transformers makes training highly parallelizable, allowing a long sequence to be processed in a distributed manner. The length of the sequences that an LLM is trained on is referred to as its context window.

The context window of a Transformer directly determines the amount of space where the examples can be provided, thus limiting its ICL ability. However, if the context window of a model is limited, there is less space to provide the model with robust examples from which ICL can be performed. Moreover, other tasks such as summarization would be severely hampered when the context window of a model is particularly short.

Following from the very nature of language itself, the position of tokens is crucial for effective modeling, whereas self-attention does not directly encode the positional information due to its parallel nature. In the architecture of Transformers, positional encoding is introduced to remedy this problem.

The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding [12]. Since then, relative positional encoding schemes [26] have further increased the performance of Transformers. Currently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [24], RoPE [28], XPos [29], and ALiBi [22].

One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training. While some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length [18].

Some works have been done to overcome such limitation. [7] and concurrently [17] proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative, we proposed the "NTK-aware" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into

### Response: 

 YaRN is a compute-efficient method for extending the context window of transformer-based language models, like Large Language Models (LLMs). It works as an extension to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), which are effective in encoding positional information within these models. However, existing RoPE models have limitations in generalizing past the sequence length they were trained on.

YaRN overcomes this issue by requiring fewer tokens and training steps compared to previous methods. It enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize and extrapolate context lengths much longer than their original pre-training, surpassing state-of-the-art results in context window extension. Moreover, YaRN demonstrates the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset.

This method showcases its efficiency when used with LLaMA models, allowing them to effectively use and extend their context windows while maintaining or improving performance. By using YaRN, transformer-based language models can process longer sequences and perform better in tasks like in-context learning (ICL) and other natural language processing applications, thus significantly extending the context window of these models for better overall performance.

1. Rotary Position Embeddings: These embeddings effectively encode positional information within transformer-based language models but face limitations in generalization past their training sequence length.
2. YaRN Extension Method: A compute-efficient approach to extend the context window of RoPE models, requiring fewer tokens and less training steps than previous methods.
3. Enhanced LLaMA Models: With YaRN, LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to much longer context lengths than their original pre-training while surpassing state-of-the-art results in context window extension.
4. Extrapolation beyond Fine-tuning Data Context: YaRN also exhibits the capability of extrapolating context beyond a fine-tuning dataset, further enhancing the performance and capabilities of these models.
5. Improved In-context Learning & Other NLP Tasks: With extended context windows, transformer-based language models can better process longer sequences for improved in-context learning and overall natural language processing applications.

In summary, YaRN is a computationally efficient method for extending the context window of RoPE-based Large Language Models like LLaMA, allowing them to utilize and extrapolate to much longer context lengths than their original pre-training while maintaining or improving performance in various natural language processing tasks.

Formula: 
Context Window Extension (CWE) = YaRN Method Applied to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE).
Performance Improvement (PI) = Enhanced LLaMA Models with extended context windows through YaRN.
In-context Learning (ICL) & Natural Language Processing Tasks Performance (NNPTP) = Optimized by extended context window using YaRN method within language models.

1. Rotary Position Embeddings limitation in generalization past the sequence length they were trained on is addressed with YaRN extension method.
2. Enhanced LLaMA Models utilize and extrapolate to much longer context lengths than their original pre-training, surpassing state-of-the-art results.
